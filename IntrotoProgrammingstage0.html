    <h2>File Type</h2>
     <P>The main type is HTML. HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup  Language.</em></P>

     <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
     <p>HTML elements are what we use to tell a  browser how to display content in a web page. They are like boxes. 
Most HTML elements consist of an opening and a closing tag with some content between them.</br>

Tag is like a container. "b"  stands for bold. " i" stands for italics. </p>
    
    <h2>Computers are stupid.</h2>
    <p>Computer programming languages are straightforward. A tiny mistake can lead to a huge problems. </p>
    
    <h2>
     Document Structure
