 <h1>0.Basic of the web and HTML</h1>

    <h2>How The Web Works</h2>
     <p>Four pieces of the web are your computer, browser, HTTP and the servers.</p>
     <em>Every File type can be found on the Internet </em>. 
  
    <h2>File Type</h2>
     <P> The main type is HTML. HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em>HTML5 is the current  HTML version that we used in the stage.</P>

    <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
     <p>HTML elements are what we use to tell a  browser how to display content in a web page. They are like boxes. 
Most HTML elements consist of an opening and a closing tag with some content between them.<br>

Tag is like a container. "b"  stands for bold. " i" stands for italics. </p>
    
    <h2>Computers are stupid.</h2>
    <p>Computer programming languages are straightforward. A tiny mistake can lead to a huge problems. </p>
    
    <h2>Document Structure</h2> 
     <p>Elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside themselves.</p>
     
 <h1>1.Make a Web Page</h1>
 
   <h2>Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML tells the browser the content of pages, which one is text or which one is image, and so on. </p>
